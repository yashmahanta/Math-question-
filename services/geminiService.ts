${markInstruction}

Analyze the entire paper, identify each question, and then generate the appropriate solution based on the instruction above.

Important instructions:
1. Do not repeat or write out the questions from the paper in your answer. Only provide the solutions, numbered to correspond with the questions.
2. Format your final output in a single markdown block.
3. CRITICAL FORMATTING RULE: Absolutely no LaTeX. Do not use underscores.
4. For fractions, you MUST use the forward slash '/' symbol (e.g., 3/4).
5. For variables that would normally have a subscript, like x‚ÇÅ, you MUST write it as x1 (without the underscore).`;
